# Lab 9 notes

- Live-code the Flask web app, explaining what's going on
- At the end, should be able to CURL the app running locally with a GET request and a POST request

- Now, we're going to build it as a Docker container
    - go through each line
    - cover .dockerignore

- Now, we're going to deploy to Lambda
